1. Give the two definitions of "Vectorization" as introduced in this chapter.
2. When is vectorization faster than for-loops in Python? 
3. When is vectorization slower than for-loops in Python?
4. What are the limitations of vectorization?
5. Do some research, and find out how CPU and GPU differ in their approach to parallelizing computation. If GPU is always "faster" than CPU, e.g. for deep learning, why do we still need CPU?
6. Define mltithreading.
7. Define multiprocessing.
8. Define multi-worker distributed computing.
9. How do we decide when to use vectorization vs. multithreading vs. multiprocessing vs. multi-worker computing? Consider scale of the data, and the complexity of the operation.
10. Do some research and list several frameworks for distributed computing in Python that are similar to Apache Beam.
