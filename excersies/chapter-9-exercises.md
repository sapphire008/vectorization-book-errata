1. Try to apply the `np_mean_reduceat` on the following data:
    ```python
    data = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])
    indices = np.array([0, 3, 8])
    ```
    What is the result? Is this expected? Try to verify it using a simple Python for-loop.
2. Try to implement `tf_sparse_segment_prod` instead using PyTorch using `torch.scatter_add`.
